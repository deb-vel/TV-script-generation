    "**Answer:** At first I tried a lot of hyperparameters but the training loss never went below 9.  After a couple of attempts I rechecked my model and noticed I was using a sigmoid function and then I tried a softmax function.  This made the model train slower and stopped it before the first training loss was displayed.  I then removed any activation function, and the model started to train a bit better but reached a training loss of less than 3.5 after 15 epochs, which means that it took long to converge.  I then rechecked the actual model again and removed the extra dropout on the LSTM output.  This resulted in a faster converging training loss as shown above, which managed to then reach a training loss of 2.9 at epoch 18.  The hyperparameters where changed several times:\n",
    "* sequence length between 6-10 since it should see some context before but not too much.\n",
    "* batch size between 32-256 always keeping with the power of 2 method\n",
    "* number of epochs was always kept at 20\n",
    "* learning rate was tweaked to be 0.01, 0.001 an 0.002 and the best one was found to be 0.001\n",
    "* embedding_dim was set to one of these 3 each time: 200 or 300 or 400.  I chose the middle way\n",
    "* hidden_dim was always set between 64 and 256 keeping with the power of 2 method.  The 256 gave great results\n",
